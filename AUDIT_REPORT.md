## 🚨 **Critical Issues Found & FIXED**

### **1. Platform Compatibility Bug** ⚠️ **CRITICAL - FIXED**
**Problem:** `harvester_v2.py` line 42 used `hasattr(platform, 'node')` which is incorrect. `platform.node()` always exists but can fail or return empty strings on some systems.

**Impact:** Would cause harvester crashes on systems where `platform.node()` fails.

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# Before (BROKEN):
device_name = f"{self.config.role}-{platform.node() if hasattr(platform, 'node') else 'unknown'}"

# After (FIXED):
try:
    hostname = platform.node()
    if not hostname:  # Can return empty string
        hostname = 'unknown'
except Exception:  # Can raise OSError on some systems
    hostname = 'unknown'
device_name = f"{self.config.role}-{hostname}"
```

### **2. File Operation Error Handling** ⚠️ **MEDIUM - FIXED**
**Problem:** `generate_playlists.py` lacked proper error handling for file operations, could crash on permission errors or disk full conditions.

**Impact:** System crashes when playlist generation fails due to filesystem issues.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added comprehensive try-catch for file operations
- Added directory creation with error handling
- Added detailed error logging

### **3. Cross-Platform Filename Sanitization** ⚠️ **MEDIUM - FIXED**
**Problem:** Artist name sanitization was incomplete, could create invalid filenames on Windows or with unicode characters.

**Impact:** Playlist generation would fail for artists with special characters in names.

**Fix Applied:**
```python
def _sanitize_filename(self, filename: str) -> str:
    """Sanitize filename for cross-platform compatibility."""
    if not filename or not filename.strip():
        return "Unknown_Artist"
    
    # Remove/replace invalid filename characters for Windows/Unix
    import string
    valid_chars = f"-_.() {string.ascii_letters}{string.digits}"
    sanitized = ''.join(c if c in valid_chars else '_' for c in filename)
    
    # Normalize whitespace and underscores
    sanitized = re.sub(r'[_\s]+', '_', sanitized).strip('_')
    
    # Limit length and ensure not empty
    sanitized = sanitized[:100] if len(sanitized) > 100 else sanitized
    
    return sanitized if sanitized else "Unknown_Artist"
```

### **4. Import Error Handling** ⚠️ **LOW - FIXED**
**Problem:** CLI module could crash if harvester manager import failed, providing poor error messages.

**Impact:** Confusing error messages when dependencies are missing.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added detailed exception handling for import failures
- Added informative warning messages
- Graceful degradation when modules are unavailable

### **5. FFmpeg Path Detection** ⚠️ **LOW - FIXED**
**Problem:** Setup script had weak FFmpeg path detection that could fail on some systems.

**Impact:** Setup might fail to find FFmpeg even when it's available.

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# Better FFmpeg path detection with fallback
ffmpeg_path = shutil.which('ffmpeg')
if not ffmpeg_path:
    # Try common locations as fallback
    common_paths = ['/usr/bin/ffmpeg', '/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg', './ffmpeg.exe']
    for path in common_paths:
        if Path(path).exists():
            ffmpeg_path = path
            break
    else:
        ffmpeg_path = 'ffmpeg'  # Let yt-dlp find it
```

### **6. Cookie File Validation** ⚠️ **LOW - FIXED**
**Problem:** Harvester could try to use empty or invalid cookie files without validation.

**Impact:** Downloads would fail silently with poor error messages.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added file size validation for cookies.txt
- Added informative logging when cookies are missing/empty
- Better error handling around cookie file operations
