## 🚨 **Critical Issues Found & FIXED**

### **1. Incomplete Daemon Mode Execution** ⚠️ **CRITICAL - FIXED**
**Problem:** `harvester_v2.py` main function checked for `--daemon` argument but never actually called `run_daemon()`, causing daemon mode to fail completely.

**Files Affected:** `harvester_v2.py`

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# Fixed: Proper argument parsing and daemon mode execution
def main():
    daemon_mode = False
    
    # Parse command line arguments
    i = 1
    while i < len(sys.argv):
        arg = sys.argv[i]
        if arg == '--daemon':
            daemon_mode = True
        elif arg in ['main', 'secondary', 'mobile']:
            role = arg
        i += 1
    
    # Run in appropriate mode
    if daemon_mode:
        # Fixed: Actually call run_daemon() when --daemon flag is present
        harvester.run_daemon()
    else:
        # Fixed: Run single harvest cycle for non-daemon mode
        harvester.run_harvest_cycle()
```

**Impact:** Daemon mode completely non-functional. **Now works correctly.**

### **2. Cross-Platform Process Detection Issues** ⚠️ **CRITICAL - FIXED**
**Problem:** `harvester_manager.py` used platform-specific commands that fail on different operating systems.

**Files Affected:** `harvester_manager.py`

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# Fixed: Use psutil for more reliable cross-platform process detection
import psutil
for proc in psutil.process_iter(['pid', 'name', 'cmdline']):
    try:
        cmdline = proc.info['cmdline']
        if cmdline and any('harvester_v2.py' in arg for arg in cmdline):
            return True
    except (psutil.NoSuchProcess, psutil.AccessDenied, psutil.ZombieProcess):
        continue
return False
```

**Impact:** Process management would fail on Windows. **Now works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.**

### **3. Device Name Generation Robustness** ⚠️ **MEDIUM - FIXED**
**Problem:** `harvester_v2.py` used fragile platform detection that could fail.

**Files Affected:** `harvester_v2.py`

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# Fixed: More robust cross-platform device name generation
try:
    hostname = platform.node() or 'unknown'
except Exception:
    hostname = 'unknown'

# Sanitize hostname for cross-platform compatibility
hostname = re.sub(r'[^\w\-\.]', '_', hostname)[:50]
device_name = f"{self.config.role}-{hostname}"
```

**Impact:** Device registration could fail with invalid hostnames. **Now generates safe device names.**

### **4. CLI Logging Directory Creation** ⚠️ **MEDIUM - FIXED**
**Problem:** `cli.py` tried to create log files without ensuring the log directory exists.

**Files Affected:** `cli.py`

**Fix Applied:**
```python
def setup_logging(self):
    """Setup logging for CLI operations."""
    # Fixed: Ensure log directory exists before creating log files
    log_dir = Path('Project5001/Logs')
    log_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    
    logging.basicConfig(...)
```

**Impact:** CLI could crash on first run if log directory doesn't exist. **Now creates directories automatically.**
