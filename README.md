# 5001
A self-hosted, fault-tolerant music archival system built to overcome YouTube’s 5,000 playlist limit. Offline-first. Spite-built. Closed-system.


# 🎧 Project 5001

> *Youtube limited me to 5000 songs, so I am taking matters into my own hands.*

---

**Project 5001 (or, just 5001)** is made to free me.  
It started the moment I realised YouTube wouldn't save more than 5,000 tracks in a playlist.  
No subscription, no algorithm, no ads, no bureaucrats picking what songs I get to keep.  
This project is my way of taking back control from bloat, from drift, from artificial caps.

It’s not a streaming service.  
It’s not a database.  
It’s a vault. My vault of taste, curated and indestructible.

Built around a single principle:

> _The playlist never ends._

## ✦ Philosophy

- **Offline-first.** If the Google explodes tomorrow, the music stays.
- **Sync everything. Own everything. Back everything.**
- **No compression. No DMCA victims. No missing tracks.**
- Built by me. Powered by my music. Shared with you.

## 🧪 Current State

5001 is still in the forge.  
As of writing it's all still in my head, but it won’t stay that way.  
Soon it will:

- Rip full YouTube playlists cleanly, audio-only
- Auto-tag and store my songs in structured formats
- Sync across my main devices via local mesh (Syncthing, no cloud)
- Stream locally, cache permanently
- Self-assess and debug during development via cloud agents.

## ⚠️ This Repo Is For Me

You’re welcome to read it, fork it, or adapt it.  
But this isn't a product, and it's not a one-size-fits-all.
It's me making sure I get what I want.

## 🧱 The Stack (Soon)

- 🛠️ `yt-dlp` for harvesting  
- 🎧 `mutagen` for tagging  
- 🧬 `Syncthing` for device mesh  
- 🎛️ `Navidrome` for streaming  
- 🤖 Background agents to automate dev & test edge cases

## 🕳️ Lore

> Project 5001 isn’t named after a file.  
> It’s named after the **first song YouTube wouldn’t let me save**.

**More to come.**  
Take back control of your music.
