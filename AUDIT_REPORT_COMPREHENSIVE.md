## 🔧 **Critical Fixes Applied**

### **1. Database Schema Compatibility** 🔴 → 🟢
**Files:** `status.py`, `generate_playlists.py`
```python
# BEFORE: Inconsistent column handling
date_column = 'ts' if 'ts' in columns else 'download_date'

# AFTER: Migration with consistency
if 'ts' in columns and 'download_date' not in columns:
    logging.warning("Migrating legacy 'ts' column to 'download_date'")
    cursor.execute('ALTER TABLE videos ADD COLUMN download_date TIMESTAMP')
    cursor.execute('UPDATE videos SET download_date = ts WHERE download_date IS NULL')
```

### **2. Command Construction Bug** 🔴 → 🟢
**File:** `harvester_v2.py`
```python
# BEFORE: Dangerous insert() operations could break command order
cmd.insert(1, '--cookies')
cmd.insert(2, 'cookies.txt')

# AFTER: Safe extend() operations preserve order
cmd.extend(['--cookies', 'cookies.txt'])
```

### **3. Database Connection Management** 🔴 → 🟢
**File:** `rate_limiter.py`
```python
# BEFORE: Potential connection leaks
def deactivate_device(self, device_id: str) -> bool:
    try:
        conn = sqlite3.connect(self.db.db_path)
        # ... operations ...
        conn.close()  # Could be skipped if exception occurs

# AFTER: Guaranteed cleanup
def deactivate_device(self, device_id: str) -> bool:
    conn = None
    try:
        conn = sqlite3.connect(self.db.db_path)
        # ... operations ...
    finally:
        if conn:
            conn.close()  # Always executed
```

### **4. Database Concurrency Handling** 🔴 → 🟢
**File:** `database.py`
```python
# ADDED: Retry logic for database locks
for attempt in range(max_retries):
    try:
        conn = sqlite3.connect(self.db_path)
        cursor.execute('PRAGMA busy_timeout = 30000')  # 30 seconds
        # ... operations ...
    except sqlite3.OperationalError as e:
        if "locked" in str(e).lower() and attempt < max_retries - 1:
            logging.warning(f"Database locked, retrying... (attempt {attempt + 1})")
            time.sleep(1)
            continue
```

### **5. Enhanced Process Detection** 🔴 → 🟢
**File:** `harvester_manager.py`
```python
# BEFORE: Platform-specific command-line tools
if platform.system() == "Windows":
    result = subprocess.run(['tasklist', ...])

# AFTER: Robust psutil-based detection
for proc in psutil.process_iter(['pid', 'name', 'cmdline']):
    if any('harvester_v2.py' in arg for arg in cmdline):
        return True
```
